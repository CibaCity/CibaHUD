DISCLAIMER: cl_hud_minmode 1 not FULLY supported, it works, but some stuff isnt in the right spots yet

This hud is a bunch of my favorite features from old/other HUD's that I frankensteined together as an expirement. The tinkering of things quickly turned into editing and changing features and now is a full fledged unique-ish HUD.


History:


cibaHUD v1: rayshud base, with changed health, ammo and damage number colors


cibaHUD v2: rayshud base, with aformentioned changes with new team selection and health cross


cibaHUD v3: switched to m0rehud base, brought along rayshud scoreboard and prevoius changes. switched to use a font of my choosing


cibaHUD v4: switched to hypnotizehud base bacuse of classy mainmenu. Carried previus edits, but added woolensleevelet loadout panel and changed up the look of the console


cibaHUD v5: pretty much current version, changed up the main menu, added custom background
